                    <p>We, Joe Coyle Financial Consultants Ltd act as intermediary (Broker) between you, the consumer, and the product provider with whom we place your business.</p>
                    <h2>The background</h2>
                    <p>Pursuant to provision 4.58A of the Central Bank of Ireland's September 2019 Addendum to the Consumer Protection Code, all intermediaries, must make available in their public offices, or on their website if they have one, a summary of the details of all arrangements for any fee, commission, other reward or remuneration provided to the intermediary which it has agreed with its product producers.</p>
                    <h2>What is commission?</h2>
                    <p>For the purpose of this document, commission is the payment earned by the intermediary for work undertaken on behalf of both the provider and the consumer. The amount of commission is generally directly related to the quantity or value of the products sold.</p>
                    <p>There are different types of commission models:</p>
                    <figure>
                      <table>
                        <tbody>
                          <tr>
                            <td>Single commission model:</td>
                            <td>where payment is made to the intermediary shortly after the sale is completed and is based on a percentage of the premium paid/amount invested/amountborrowed.&nbsp;</td>
                          </tr>
                          <tr>
                            <td>Trail/Renewal commission model:</td>
                            <td>Further payments at intervals are paid throughout the life span of theproduct.</td>
                          </tr>
                          <tr>
                            <td>Indemnity commission</td>
                            <td>Indemnity commission is the term used to describe a commission payment made before the commission is deemed to be 'earned'. Indemnity commission may be subject to a clawback (see below) if the consumer lapses or cancels the product before the commission is deemed to be earned.</td>
                          </tr>
                        </tbody>
                      </table>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Other forms of indemnity commission are advances of commission for future sales granted to intermediaries in order to assist with set up costs or business development.</p>
                    <h3>General insurance products</h3>
                    <p>General insurance products, such as motor, home, travel, health, retail or liability insurance, are typically subject to a single or standard commission model, based on the amount of premium charged for the insurance product.</p>
                    <h3>Profit Share arrangements</h3>
                    <p>In some cases, the intermediary may be a party to a profit-share arrangement with a product provider and will earn additional commission. Any business arranged with these product providers on a client's behalf will be placed with the product provider because that product provider is at the time of placement, the most suitable to meet the client's requirements, taking all the client's relevant information, demands and needs into account.</p>
                    <h3>Life Assurance/Investments/Pension products</h3>
                    <p>For Life Assurance products commission is divided into initial commission and renewal commission (related to premium), fund based or trail relating to accumulated fund.</p>
                    <p>Trail commission, bullet commission, fund based or renewal commission are all terms used for ongoing payments. Where an investment fund is being built up though an insurance-based investment product or a pension product, the increments may be based on a percentage of the value of the fund or the annual premium. For a single premium/lump sum product, the increment is generally based on the value of the fund.</p>
                    <p>Examples of products include Life Protection, Regular Premium Life Assurance Investments, Single Premium (lump sum) Insurance-based Investments, and Single Premium Pensions.</p>
                    <h3>Investments</h3>
                    <p>Investment firms, which fall within the
                      scope of the European Communities (Markets in Financial Instruments) Regulations
                      2007 (the MiFID Regulations), offer both standard commission and commission
                      models involving initial and trail commission. Increments may be based on a
                      percentage of the investment management fees, or on the value of the
                      fund.</p>
                    <h3>Credit Products/Mortgages</h3>
                    <p>Commission may be earned by
                      intermediaries for arranging credit for consumers, such as mortgages. The
                      single, or standard, commission model is the most common commission model
                      applied to the sale of mortgage products by mortgage credit intermediaries
                      (Mortgage Broker).</p>
                    <h3>Clawback</h3>
                    <p>Clawback is an obligation on the
                      intermediary to repay unearned commission. Commission can be paid directly after
                      a contract is concluded but is not deemed to be 'earned' until after a specified
                      period of time. If the consumer cancels or withdraws from the financial product
                      within the specified time, the intermediary must return commission to the
                      product producer.</p>
                    <h3>Fees</h3>
                    <p>The firm may also be remunerated by fee by
                      the product producer such as policy fee, admin fee, or in the case of investment
                      firms, advisory fees. Include arrangements etc</p>
                    <h3>Please Note</h3>
                    <p>The
                      enclosed commission guidance section gives indicative values across every
                      product provider and every product advised whereby a commission or fee is
                      received within our business. This is the maximum our Brokerage will take and is
                      subject to change, in certain cases our Brokerage may take a different
                      remuneration than the enclosed percentages/amounts. This will be disclosed to
                      each client as per the Central Bank Consumer Protection Code regulations, on a
                      client by client basis.</p>

                              with a client a recurring commission that may be based on a percentage of the
                              value of the fund or the annual premium. If for some reason a client moves or
                              terminates their policy within a particular period of time, this might result in
                              the provider seeking to "clawback" some or all of the commission paid to the
                              broker, depending on how long the policy was active with the provider.</p>
